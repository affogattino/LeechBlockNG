LeechBlock Focus is an enhanced version of LeechBlock NG (Next Generation), a simple productivity tool designed to block those time-wasting sites that can suck the life out of your working day. All you need to do is specify which sites to block and when to block them.

The focus page pauses your browsing to reflect on your goal for visiting the site.
